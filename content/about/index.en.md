### About Me

Mohamed Adel is my name, I'm a malware analyst, reverse engineer, and DFIR investigator. If you're into pulling apart malicious code and connecting the dots in a cyber incident, you've come to the right place. This blog is where I share what I'm working on and what I'm learning in this world.
