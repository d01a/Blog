## Syscalls? Why?

- To Bypass user-mood hooks. why?
  - For Hiding a code inside a legitimate process (Process Injection)
  - Avoiding EDR alerts!

### User-mood Hooks

Hooking user-mode functions by placing a jump to another code section. EDRs use hooks to check the function parameters. For example, if you are trying to change the memory protections of some data to add executable protections. This is a very suspicious activity so EDRs will be alert to that. Most Hooks are on the lowest level of the user-mode interface in **ntdll.dll** which are the system calls.

## Direct syscalls

Windows has a defined schema of how `syscalls` are used. Most of the documented windows APIs are just a wrapper of a lower-level Functions in `ntdll.dll` which are compiled to a `syscall` with the right SSN (System Service Number). To look at how `Nt*` version of the higher-level API is implemented.

```
0:018> uf NtOpenProcess
ntdll!NtOpenProcess:
00007ffa`4874d4c0 4c8bd1          mov     r10,rcx
00007ffa`4874d4c3 b826000000      mov     eax,26h
00007ffa`4874d4c8 f604250803fe7f01 test    byte ptr [SharedUserData+0x308 (00000000`7ffe0308)],1
00007ffa`4874d4d0 7503            jne     ntdll!NtOpenProcess+0x15 (00007ffa`4874d4d5)  Branch

ntdll!NtOpenProcess+0x12:
00007ffa`4874d4d2 0f05            syscall
00007ffa`4874d4d4 c3              ret

ntdll!NtOpenProcess+0x15:
00007ffa`4874d4d5 cd2e            int     2Eh
00007ffa`4874d4d7 c3              ret

```

At address `00007ffa~4874d4d2` there `syscall` instruction. This instruction transfers the execution to the system-handler at the kernel. The handler is specified using pre-defined SSN number loaded into `EAX` Register (In this case `EAX = 0x26` at address `00007ffa~4874d4c3`).
So, to make a `syscall` The SSN associated.
The code stub of the `syscalls` is simple.

```nasm
mov r10, rcx
mov eax, <syscall_number>
syscall
ret

```

Now, the missing thing is the `syscall_number`. These numbers are changing based on the Build version of windows. There are some techniques to get these numbers.

1. **SysWhispers**

[SysWhispers](https://github.com/jthuraisamy/SysWhispers) That generate the table of these numbers in the form of a header file and assembly file that can be embedded in the code. The generated code contains `syscall` number for multiple versions, The right windows build version is detected at runtime using PEB structure.

```
...
+0x118 OSMajorVersion   : Uint4B
+0x11c OSMinorVersion   : Uint4B
+0x120 OSBuildNumber    : Uint2B
...

```

The assembly code generated (Full document at [example-output](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jthuraisamy/SysWhispers/master/example-output/syscalls.asm))

```nasm
...
NtOpenProcess PROC
	mov rax, gs:[60h]                       ; Load PEB into RAX.
NtOpenProcess_Check_X_X_XXXX:               ; Check major version.
	cmp dword ptr [rax+118h], 5
	je  NtOpenProcess_SystemCall_5_X_XXXX
	cmp dword ptr [rax+118h], 6
	je  NtOpenProcess_Check_6_X_XXXX
	cmp dword ptr [rax+118h], 10
	je  NtOpenProcess_Check_10_0_XXXX
	jmp NtOpenProcess_SystemCall_Unknown
NtOpenProcess_Check_6_X_XXXX:               ; Check minor version for Windows Vista/7/8.
	cmp dword ptr [rax+11ch], 0
	je  NtOpenProcess_Check_6_0_XXXX
	cmp dword ptr [rax+11ch], 1
	je  NtOpenProcess_Check_6_1_XXXX
	cmp dword ptr [rax+11ch], 2
	je  NtOpenProcess_SystemCall_6_2_XXXX
	cmp dword ptr [rax+11ch], 2
	je  NtOpenProcess_SystemCall_6_3_XXXX
	jmp NtOpenProcess_SystemCall_Unknown
NtOpenProcess_Check_6_0_XXXX:               ; Check build number for Windows Vista.
	cmp dword ptr [rax+120h], 6000
	je  NtOpenProcess_SystemCall_6_0_6000
	cmp dword ptr [rax+120h], 6001
	je  NtOpenProcess_SystemCall_6_0_6001
	cmp dword ptr [rax+120h], 6002
	je  NtOpenProcess_SystemCall_6_0_6002
	jmp NtOpenProcess_SystemCall_Unknown
NtOpenProcess_Check_6_1_XXXX:               ; Check build number for Windows 7.
	cmp dword ptr [rax+120h], 7600
	je  NtOpenProcess_SystemCall_6_1_7600
	cmp dword ptr [rax+120h], 7601
	je  NtOpenProcess_SystemCall_6_1_7601
	jmp NtOpenProcess_SystemCall_Unknown
NtOpenProcess_Check_10_0_XXXX:              ; Check build number for Windows 10.
	cmp dword ptr [rax+120h], 10240
	je  NtOpenProcess_SystemCall_10_0_10240
	cmp dword ptr [rax+120h], 10586
	je  NtOpenProcess_SystemCall_10_0_10586
	...

```

1. **SSN code stub**
   This technique doesn't Look for SSN number, instead it gets the code stub of the required API. This can be done by opening the PE file and parsing the Export table of `ntdll`
2. **Extract SSN**
   It Extract the SSN from `ntdll` by parsing the Export table. The difference between it and the previous one is that it only extracts the `syscall` number. Both methods load `ntdll.dll` from the disk first using win32 API `OpenFile` which might be hooked. [hell's gate](https://github.com/am0nsec/HellsGate) for more.
3. **Syscalls' number sequence**
   This method take advantage of the SSNs are in a sequence for example if a syscall number is 0x26 the following will be 0x27 and so on. This relies also on the fact that not all the system calls are hooked! So, to get the SSN of a function, you need to find the nearest unhooked syscall. this was presented by [halos gate](https://blog.sektor7.net/#!res/2021/halosgate.md). But This is not valid in newer versions of Windows as the SSNs sequence is no longer valid.
4. **Parallel loading**
   This is an interesting technique explained in this [blog](https://www.mdsec.co.uk/2022/01/edr-parallel-asis-through-analysis/). It uses windows feature introduced in windows 10 to load DLLs through multiple threads instead of one in older versions of windows. It was found that the syscall stub of native Functions `NtOpenFile()`, `NtCreateSection()`, `ZwQueryAttributeFile()`, `ZwOpenSection()` and `ZwMapViewOfFile()` -There is a lot of things happens between the two actions, detailed explanation in the previously mentioned [blog](https://www.mdsec.co.uk/2022/01/edr-parallel-asis-through-analysis/) -are copied into `LdrpThunkSignature` array. This is done to check the integrity of the functions' code. These APIs' syscall numbers can be used to load a new version of ntdll.dll from the disk and avoid any user-mood hooks.
5. **Sorting by system call address**
   This technique uses the relation between the address of the system call stub and the SSN. It is known as [FreshyCalls](https://github.com/crummie5/FreshyCalls) . In simple words, it walks the Export Address Table of `ntdll` and saves the Name -or a hash of the name- and Address of each entry in a table. Then, it sorts the entries by the addresses in ascending order. It was found that the first function `NtAccessCheck` (by address) has an SSN = 0

```
0:007> uf NtAccessCheck
ntdll!NtAccessCheck:
00007ffa`4874d000 4c8bd1          mov     r10,rcx
00007ffa`4874d003 b800000000      mov     eax,0
00007ffa`4874d008 f604250803fe7f01 test    byte ptr [SharedUserData+0x308 (00000000`7ffe0308)],1
00007ffa`4874d010 7503            jne     ntdll!NtAccessCheck+0x15 (00007ffa`4874d015)  Branch

ntdll!NtAccessCheck+0x12:
00007ffa`4874d012 0f05            syscall
00007ffa`4874d014 c3              ret

ntdll!NtAccessCheck+0x15:
00007ffa`4874d015 cd2e            int     2Eh
00007ffa`4874d017 c3              ret

```

and if we unassembled the next function by adding one to the last address (as ret opcode is one byte) we will get that the next function's SSN is 1!

```
0:007> uf 00007ffa`4874d017+1
ntdll!NtAccessCheck+0x18:
00007ffa`4874d018 0f1f840000000000 nop     dword ptr [rax+rax]
00007ffa`4874d020 4c8bd1          mov     r10,rcx
00007ffa`4874d023 b801000000      mov     eax,1
00007ffa`4874d028 f604250803fe7f01 test    byte ptr [SharedUserData+0x308 (00000000`7ffe0308)],1
00007ffa`4874d030 7503            jne     ntdll!NtWorkerFactoryWorkerReady+0x15 (00007ffa`4874d035)  Branch

ntdll!NtWorkerFactoryWorkerReady+0x12:
00007ffa`4874d032 0f05            syscall
00007ffa`4874d034 c3              ret

ntdll!NtWorkerFactoryWorkerReady+0x15:
00007ffa`4874d035 cd2e            int     2Eh
00007ffa`4874d037 c3              ret

```

So, by sorting the functions by the addresses, we have the SSN. for the code, look at [MDSec](https://www.mdsec.co.uk/2020/12/bypassing-user-mode-hooks-and-direct-invocation-of-system-calls-for-red-teams/#8.%20Sorting%20by%20System%20Call%20Address) (8. Sorting by System Call Address) blog or see [FreshlyCalls](https://github.com/crummie5/FreshyCalls/blob/112bdf0db63a5f7104ba5243af6a672bc098a1ad/syscall.cpp#L65) implementation.
The execution of the system call is not direct by calling `syscall` instruction. Instead. It uses the method explained below. Briefly, it uses the `syscall` instructions from `ntdll`.

## Indirect syscalls

All the methods described are workarounds to get the system call number without getting caught. `syscall` instruction reveals that some suspicious activity is going on. This is done using `KPROCESS!InstrumentationCallback` in windows.

```
0:030> dt _kprocess
ntdll!_KPROCESS
   +0x000 Header           : _DISPATCHER_HEADER
   ...
   +0x3d8 InstrumentationCallback : Ptr64 Void
   ...
   +0x3f8 EndPadding       : [8] Uint8B

```

Any time the windows is done with a syscall and returns to user-mode, it checks this member it is not `NULL`, the execution will be transferred to that pointer. To check if the syscall is legit, the return address after finishing the syscall is checked to see if it is not from a valid place. If the address is in the address space of the process running, it's not a legitimate place to make a syscall. This check was done by ScyllaHide to detect manual syscalls, the source code can be found [here](https://github.com/x64dbg/ScyllaHide/blob/master/HookLibrary/HookedFunctions.cpp#L176-L187).

```c
 if (InterlockedOr(TlsGetInstrumentationCallbackDisabled(), 0x1) == 0x1)
        return ReturnVal; // Do not recurse

    const PVOID ImageBase = NtCurrentPeb()->ImageBaseAddress;
    const PIMAGE_NT_HEADERS NtHeaders = RtlImageNtHeader(ImageBase);
    if (NtHeaders != nullptr && ReturnAddress >= (ULONG_PTR)ImageBase &&
        ReturnAddress < (ULONG_PTR)ImageBase + NtHeaders->OptionalHeader.SizeOfImage)
    {
        // Syscall return address within the exe file
        ReturnVal = (ULONG_PTR)(ULONG)STATUS_PORT_NOT_SET;

        // Uninstall ourselves after we have completed the sequence { NtQIP, NtQIP }. More NtSITs will follow but we can't do anything about them
        NumManualSyscalls++;
        if (NumManualSyscalls >= 2)
        {
            InstallInstrumentationCallbackHook(NtCurrentProcess, TRUE);
        }
    }

    InterlockedAnd(TlsGetInstrumentationCallbackDisabled(), 0);

    return ReturnVal;
}

```

It checks the return address of the successful system call. If it resides on the address space of the binary we are running, it is an indication of manual system call.

**The Solution**
The solution to this hooking method is done by [Bouncy Gate](https://github.com/eversinc33/BouncyGate) and [Recycled Gate](https://github.com/thefLink/RecycledGate) method. The idea is quite simple, it is an adjusted version of [Hell's Gate](https://github.com/eversinc33/BouncyGate). Instead of directly executing `syscall` instruction and getting caught by static signatures and system call callbacks described above, the author replaces the `syscall` instruction with a trampoline jump (`JMP`) to a `syscall` instruction address from `ntdll.dll`. now there is no direct `syscall` instruction and the system call originated from a legitimate place `ntdll`. This is also implemented in [SysWhispers3](https://github.com/klezVirus/SysWhispers3). To get the address of the syscall instruction in `ntdll` we can parse the export table and search for syscall, ret opcodes `0F 05 0C` or the constant pattern of syscalls in `ntdll` can be used to get the syscall address. If the function is not hooked, the syscall instruction is on offset `0x12` from the function's address, we can verify that by comparing the opcodes.

## Indirect syscalls in Cobalt Strike

The sample from [Dodo's blog](https://github.com/dodo-sec/Malware-Analysis/blob/main/Cobalt%20Strike/Indirect%20Syscalls.md) Where he already analyzed how indirect syscalls implemented in Cobalt Strike. for easy access, here is [UnpacMe Results 020b20098f808301cad6025fe7e2f93fa9f3d0cc5d3d0190f27cf0cd374bcf04](https://www.unpac.me/results/4a29ad52-97b6-4208-a8e2-2cd99be3fff4#/). The sample is packed. The unpacking process is easy. Just put a breakpoint on `VirtualProtect` and get the base address (First Argument).
Function `sub_18001B6B0` contains the important part, system call SSN retrieving and execution methods. You can get to this function by following the `call` instruction to `rax` which contains a `qword` memory area or a call to the `qword` directly. These locations are populated with addresses of the required APIs in this function.
We can see multiple calls to `sub_18001A73C` with arguments: `qword_*`, a hash (such as `0B12B7A69h`), variable passed to the function `sub_18001A7F4` and another allocated memory which is also passed to `sub_18001A7F4`.

![Untitled](Syscalls%20usag%20fbb8d8171051465da6fe612f944e8a0f/Untitled.png)

Function `sub_18001A73C` is to resolve the function address (`syscall` stub address) by the hash. And function `sub_18001A7F4` used to populate the list with the system call SSN and system call stub. So, `sub_18001A7F4` is our target. In the following picture is the beginning of the function.

![Untitled](Syscalls%20usag%20fbb8d8171051465da6fe612f944e8a0f/Untitled%201.png)

The function starts with getting a pointer to the first entry in `InLoadOrderModuleList` structure by going through reading the Process Environment Block (PEB). here in the picture, r10 is holding the current entry of the structure and r9 is like a variable to get each entry, this is the breaking condition of the loop as the `_LIST_ENTRY` structure wrap around itself (doubly linked list).

The next step is to get the Export directory of `ntdll.dll` but first, get `ntdll` address in memory.

![Untitled](Syscalls%20usag%20fbb8d8171051465da6fe612f944e8a0f/Untitled%202.png)

It is looking for the right module in the `InLoadOrderModuleList` by going through each entry, the `flink` is a pointer to `LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY` where we can get a pointer to the module. By parsing the module (going through PE file headers) to get the name of the DLL which resides in the Export directory (First member) which is the first member of `IMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY` structure. It is then tested to see if it is the target module (`ntdll`).
If the module is `ntdll`, it saves a pointer to `AddressOfFunctions`, `AddressOfNames` and `AddressOfNameOrdinals`. A memory region of size 0x1f40 is then zeroed as it will hold the structures of the system call information needed.
The next part is checking the function prefix `Ki` and `Zw`. It looks for only one function prefixed by `Ki` with the hash `8DCD4499h`, but I couldn't find function with this hash (using debugger). Then, a call to a hashing function is made. The hashing function is simple.

![Untitled](Syscalls%20usag%20fbb8d8171051465da6fe612f944e8a0f/Untitled%203.png)

It uses `0x52964EE9` as an initial key value to start the process then:

- Get 2-bytes of the Function name (little endian).
- Rotate the key by 8 (2 characters).
- Add the key and the 2-bytes of the name.
- Increment the counter by 1 (Resulting that all the chars in between the start and end taken two times in the calculation for example `ZwOpenProcess` will take `Wz` in the first iteration and `Ow` in the second and so on).
- The result of the addition is XORed with the key to produce the new key.
  The hash value returned is the last result of the XOR operation.

The resulting value is stored in the following form, in the pre-allocated space.

![Untitled](Syscalls%20usag%20fbb8d8171051465da6fe612f944e8a0f/Untitled%204.png)

- The first `DWORD` is the hash.
- The second `DWORD` is the Relative Virtual Address (RVA) of the system call0.
- The third `QWORD` is the Virtual Address (VA) of the system call stub (RVA + ntdll Base Address).

So, it can be written as:

```c
struct syscall_info {
DWORD API_hash;
DWORD syscall_stub_RVA;
QWORD syscall_stub_address;
};

```

After populating the structure with the addresses. The structure elements are being sorted by the RVA of the system call stub (second entry in the structure).

![Untitled](Syscalls%20usag%20fbb8d8171051465da6fe612f944e8a0f/Untitled%205.png)

After the sorting algorithm is done, the memory structure look like the following:

![Untitled](Syscalls%20usag%20fbb8d8171051465da6fe612f944e8a0f/Untitled%206.png)

The first address is the address to the Lowest address `ZwMapUserPhysicalPagesScatter` (Could be different at newer versions of windows) at address `00000000774E1340` If we see the system call SSN of it:

![Untitled](Syscalls%20usag%20fbb8d8171051465da6fe612f944e8a0f/Untitled%207.png)

system call number is zero. This is how it gets the SSN for any function, by iterating the structure to get the right hash, the counter will be used to get the SSN (SSN = counter).
So far, this is remarkably like [MDSec](https://www.mdsec.co.uk/2020/12/bypassing-user-mode-hooks-and-direct-invocation-of-system-calls-for-red-teams/#8.%20Sorting%20by%20System%20Call%20Address) (8. Sorting by System Call Address) implementation of the technique known as `FreshlyCalls`.
We could rewrite the technique using MDSec implementation as follows:

```c
#define RVA2VA(Type, DllBase, Rva) (Type)((ULONG_PTR) DllBase + Rva)

    for(i=0; i<Entries - 1; i++) {
      for(j=0; j<Entries - i - 1; j++) {
        if(Table[j].syscall_stub_RVA > Table[j+1].syscall_stub_RVA) {
          //
          // Swap entries.
          //
          Entry.Hash = Table[j].Hash;
          Entry.Address = Table[j].Address;

          Table[j].API_Hash = Table[j+1].API_Hash;
          Table[j].syscall_stub_RVA = Table[j+1].syscall_stub_RVA;
          Table[j].syscall_stub_address = Table[j+1].syscall_stub_address;

          Table[j+1].API_Hash = Entry.API_Hash;
          Table[j+1].syscall_stub_RVA = Entry.syscall_stub_RVA;
          Table[j+1].syscall_stub_address = Entry.syscall_stub_address;

        }
      }
    }
}

The next thing is to use the structure to get the SSN. and `syscall` instruction to call. This is done by function `sub_18001A73C`.

![Untitled](Syscalls%20usag%20fbb8d8171051465da6fe612f944e8a0f/Untitled%208.png)

The function takes the following parameters:

- The array of structures that has the system call info (called `syscall_info` above)
- constant value 0x1F4 the maximum length of the structure members (structure size = 0x1F4 \* 0x10).
- Pre-Allocated memory
- The function hash.
- Global variable to get the system call SSN and stub.
  The function is simple, it searches the populated structure to find the given hash. If it's found, the counter value is taken and to get the Address of the system call stub. To get the address, the base address of the structure is added to the offset multiplied by 0x10 (struct size) and add 8 to get the last QWORD.

```
API_Address = *(STRUCT_BASE_ADDR + COUNTER * 0x10 + 8)

```

The address the passed to `get_syscall_ret_address` to get the `syscall ret` addresses to use it to execute the system call to bypass the callback mentioned before (call stack tracing is be used to detect this trick).

The global variable is used to store:

- QWORD to store System call address (function address at `ntdll`)
- QWORD to store `syscall` , `ret` instruction sequence address.
- DWORD to store system call number SSN.
  We can rewrite it as follows:

```c
struct syscall_required_addresses {
QWORD syscall_stub_address;
QWORD syscall_intruction_address;
DWORD syscall_number;
};
```

(Creative names I know :) )

There are some choices to call the required function. This is done based on the value at a global variable (0x18004BC6C):

- 1 : Direct call using the first member of the structure (Address of the function in `ntdll`)
- 2 : Indirect system call using trampoline jump using the system call number and the `syscall` address stored before.

![Untitled](Syscalls%20usag%20fbb8d8171051465da6fe612f944e8a0f/Untitled%2011.png)

- anything else: Direct call to Win32 API.

## Detecting syscalls

System calls can be used to bypass user mood hooks but there are other methods to detect Direct and Indirect syscalls.
To detect Direct system calls, Windows provides a large set of callback functions, one of them is `KPROCESS!InstrumentationCallback` . This callback is triggered whenever the system returns from the kernel mode to user mode. This could be used to check the return address of the `syscall` which reveals the location of `syscall` instruction execution. This location should be `ntdll` but in case of the direct system calls, it will be from the `.text` section of the PE file. This was used by [ScyllaHide](https://github.com/x64dbg/ScyllaHide/blob/master/HookLibrary/HookedFunctions.cpp).
Indirect system calls solved this problem by getting the address of `syscall` instruction in `ntdll` and jump to it. To detect indirect syscalls the call stack tracing method can be used to check from where the system call originated -before jumping to `ntdll`-. This also can be bypassed by creating a new thread to get a new call stack using callback functions like `TpAllocWork` and `RtlQueueWorkItem`.
